                   <p> 
                The next step in the process will be the scheduling of a "Settlement Conference." The idea behind the Settlement Conference is to give the homeowner an opportunity to work with the Bank to come to some alternative to foreclosure, with the Court's help. The Settlement Conference can be thought of as a "safety zone" for homeowners - while you are in the Settlement Conference phase of the foreclosure process, the foreclosure essentially is "frozen" in the Court system. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                You should receive a letter in the mail, typically a few weeks after the Summons and Complaint, from the Court with the time, date and place of the Settlement Conference. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you do not show up at your first scheduled Settlement Conference without contacting the Court, the Court may declare this stage of the foreclosure to be over, and allow the foreclosure to move forward. <br> IT IS VITAL THAT YOU ATTEND THE FIRST SCHEDULED SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE! <br> If for some reason you cannot attend the scheduled Settlement Conference, you will need to contact the Court to reschedule. Contect information can be found here.
                <!-- make "here" a link to contact info or include necessary contact info on this page -->

                <h3>Who attends a Settlement Conference</h3>
                <div>
                   The homeowner can appear at a Settlement Conference with or without an attorney. (Appearing without an attorney is referred to as appearing "pro se".) The Bank must have a representative available at the Settlement Conference. Typically, this will be the Bank's attorney.
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="stage_container c3">
                
                <h3>What should you expect at a Settlement Conference?</h3>
                <div>
                   
                   <p>
                    You will describe your situation; the Court may ask questions about your finances, your income and your debts. The Court may also ask whether you have any savings set aside. The Bank should be able to describe how much you owe and how this amount was calculated. There will be no witnesses or testimony, it is simply an opportunity for both sides to ask questions and explore solutions.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p> 
                    The Bank will likely give the homeowner a packet of forms that must be filled out and returned to the Bank, so that the Bank can review your loan for a possible "loan modification." The forms the Bank asks you to fill out are designed to give the Bank a snapshot of your current financial situation. Therefore, they will ask about both your income and your monthly expenses. Some of the forms will be specific to your Bank, while others will be forms used by all banks as required by federal law. In addition, most banks will ask for your most recent bank statements and a copy of your income taxes. Again, this is used to have a better understanding of your financial situation.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    It is very rare that you will be able to come to an agreement with the Bank at the first Settlement Conference. What typically happens that the Court will schedule another Settlement Conference for you.

                    <br>
                    The Settlement Conference is a chance for you to share your story with the court and the Bank.
                    By preparing to tell your story before the meeting, is is more likely you will tell your story in a way that everyone can understand. They will need to know why you are in foreclosure, and what you have done to resolve you situation. The clearer you are to the Court and the Bank, the easier it will be to resolve the foreclosure.

                    <br>
                    Here some sample questions you should write out:
